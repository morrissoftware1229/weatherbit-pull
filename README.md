# weatherbit-pull
This repo pulls information from the Weatherbit API. This information is then used in combination with the information returned form the oura-data-dump repo, so I can analyze how the combination of the weather and my physiological metrics predict my productivity and mood.

Unfortunately, this will need to be immediately scrapped since this API only provides access to current weather data for free, and I needed historical data.
